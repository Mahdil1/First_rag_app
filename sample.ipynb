For additional and latest information, consult www.fincen.gov/boi.\\n\\nBeneficial Ownership Information Reporting Filing Instructions \\nJanuary 2024 - Version 1.0\\n3\\nI. Who, What, When of Beneficial Ownership Information Reporting Requirements\\nThe Corporate Transparency Act requires certain types of U.S. and foreign entities to report \\nbeneficial ownership information to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a \\nbureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  Beneficial ownership information is information \\nabout the entity, its beneficial owners, and in certain cases its company applicants.  Beneficial \\nownership information is reported to FinCEN through Beneficial Ownership Information Reports \\n(BOIRs).\\nFinCEN‚Äôs website includes guidance about the beneficial ownership information reporting \\nrequirements on its beneficial ownership information webpage.  FinCEN‚Äôs Small Entity \\nCompliance Guide explains who must report, what they must report, and when they must \\nreport.  The Guide includes interactive flowcharts, checklists, and other aids to help determine \\nwhether an entity needs to file a BOIR with FinCEN, and if so, how to comply with the reporting \\nrequirements.  More information on where to look in the Small Entity Compliance Guide is \\nprovided below.\\nWHO\\nAn entity is required to report beneficial ownership information if it is a ‚Äúreporting \\ncompany‚Äù and does not qualify for an exemption.  Chapter 1 of FinCEN‚Äôs Small Entity \\nCompliance Guide may assist in determining whether an entity qualifies for an exemption.\\nWHAT\\nBeneficial ownership information is information about an entity, its beneficial owners, \\nand, in certain cases, its company applicants.  The person submitting beneficial \\nownership information to FinCEN must certify that the information is true, correct, and \\ncomplete.  The specific information required is described in these instructions and \\nin Chapter 4 of FinCEN‚Äôs Small Entity Compliance Guide.  To learn more about how \\nto identify beneficial owners, review Chapter 2 of FinCEN‚Äôs Small Entity Compliance \\nGuide.  To learn more about the reporting requirements for and how to identify company \\napplicants, review Chapter 3 of FinCEN‚Äôs Small Entity Compliance Guide.\\n\\nBeneficial Ownership Information Reporting Filing Instructions \\nJanuary 2024 - Version 1.0\\n4\\nWHEN\\nFinCEN will begin accepting BOIRs electronically through its secure filing system January \\n1, 2024.  FinCEN will not accept BOIRs prior to January 1, 2024.  \\nIf a reporting company already exists as of January 1, 2024, it must file its initial BOIR by \\nJanuary 1, 2025.  If a reporting company is created or registered to do business in the \\nUnited States on or after January 1, 2024 and before January 1, 2025, it must file its initial \\nBOIR within 90 days after receiving actual or public notice that its creation or registration \\nis effective.  If a reporting company is created or registered to do business in the United \\nStates after January 1, 2025, then it must file its initial BOIR within 30 days after receiving \\nactual or public notice that its creation or registration is effective.  \\nIf there is any change to the required information about a reporting company or its \\nbeneficial owners in a BOIR that a reporting company filed, the reporting company must \\nfile an updated BOIR no later than 30 days after the date on which the change occurred.\\nIf the reporting company identifies an inaccuracy in a BOIR that the reporting company \\nfiled, the reporting company must correct it no later than 30 days after the date the \\nreporting company became aware of the inaccuracy or had reason to know of it.\\nMore information about reporting timelines may be found in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 of \\nFinCEN‚Äôs Small Entity Compliance Guide.\\nThe rest of these filing instructions explain where and how to report beneficial ownership \\ninformation to FinCEN by filing a BOIR\\n\\nBeneficial Ownership Information Reporting Filing Instructions \\nJanuary 2024 - Version 1.0\\n5\\nII. Where to Report Beneficial Ownership Information \\nReporting companies may complete BOIRs electronically by accessing the BOI E-Filing portal at \\nhttp s://boiefiling.fincen.gov (accessible beginning on January 1, 2024).\\nThe E-Filing portal permits a reporting company to choose one of the following filing methods to \\nsubmit a BOIR:\\n‚Äî Upload finalized PDF version of BOIR and submit online.\\n‚Äî Fill out Web-based version of BOIR and submit online.\\nA reporting company may submit its BOIR through either of these methods, both of which require \\nthe filing to be done online as BOIRs cannot be mailed or faxed to FinCEN.  In each case, the \\nperson who submits a BOIR will need to provide their name and email address to FinCEN.\\nThe person who submits a BOIR will receive confirmation of submission when a BOIR is accepted \\nby FinCEN.\\nThe E-Filing submission guides for both PDF and web-based versions of the BOIR may\\nassist in submitting completed BOIRs to FinCEN.  To access these guides, go to\\nhttp s://boifiling.fincen.gov and select Help.\\nFinCEN also offers system-to-system BOIR transmission via secure Application Programming \\nInterface (API) for those, including third-party service providers, who are interested in \\nautomating the BOIR filing process.\\n\\nBeneficial Ownership Information Reporting Filing Instructions \\nJanuary 2024 - Version 1.0\\n6\\nIII. How to Report Beneficial Ownership Information\\nReport beneficial ownership information to FinCEN by filing a true, correct, and complete BOIR.  \\nThis section includes specific recommendations and instructions to assist in reporting beneficial \\nownership information to FinCEN by filing a BOIR.\\na.

Filers must also provide information in all fields not marked with the * symbol \\nthat are applicable to the filer.  For example, the ‚ÄúMiddle Name‚Äù field is not marked with a * \\nsymbol; the filer MUST provide information in that field IF the relevant individual‚Äôs legal name \\nincludes a middle name.  Notwithstanding any other instruction, reporting companies must \\nprovide all information required pursuant to 31 CFR 1010.380(b). \\nCompleting an initial BOIR: Complete an initial BOIR by providing all the following information:\\n‚Ä¢ For the reporting company: \\n ¬ª\\nFull legal name; \\n ¬ª\\nAny trade name or ‚Äúdoing business as‚Äù name; \\n ¬ª\\nComplete current U.S. address; \\n ¬ª\\nJurisdiction of formation (including State1 or Tribal jurisdiction for a domestic \\nreporting company);   \\n ¬ª\\nFor a foreign reporting company only, State or Tribal jurisdiction of first registration; \\nand\\n ¬ª\\nIRS Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), including an Employer Identification \\nNumber (EIN) (or, if a foreign reporting company has not been issued a TIN, the \\nreporting company‚Äôs foreign tax identification number and the name of the issuing \\njurisdiction).\\n1 State means any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of \\nthe Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, and any other commonwealth, territo\\xad\\nry, or possession of the United States. \\n\\nBeneficial Ownership Information Reporting Filing Instructions \\nJanuary 2024 - Version 1.0\\n7\\n‚Ä¢ For each beneficial owner and each company applicant required to be reported:  \\n ¬ª\\nFull legal name;\\n ¬ª\\nDate of birth; \\n ¬ª\\nComplete current address; \\n ¬ª\\nUnique identifying number and issuing jurisdiction from one of the following non-\\nexpired documents: (1) U.S. passport; (2) identification document issued by a State, \\nlocal government, or Indian Tribe issued for the purpose of identifying the individual; \\n(3) State-issued driver‚Äôs license; or (4) if none of (1)‚Äì(3) are available, a foreign \\npassport; and \\n ¬ª\\nAn image of the document from which the unique identifying number was obtained.\\nReporting companies may provide a FinCEN identifier for a beneficial owner or company \\napplicant instead of the information listed above.\\nCompleting a corrected or an updated BOIR: If a previously submitted BOIR needs to be \\ncorrected or updated, complete a corrected or updated BOIR in its entirety, with the necessary \\ncorrections or updates made to the information.  Reporting companies must resubmit \\nunchanged information along with the corrected or updated information.\\nCompleting a newly exempt entity BOIR: If a BOIR was previously submitted for an entity that \\nhas become exempt, complete a newly exempt entity BOIR by reporting that the type of filing is \\n‚Äúnewly exempt entity‚Äù, as well as the company name and TIN that the company provided in the \\nlast BOIR it filed.

For example, if an \\nindividual‚Äôs name is Juan (first name) Vega (first last name) Santiago (second last name), ‚ÄúVEGA \\nSANTIAGO‚Äù would be entered in the last name field and ‚ÄúJUAN‚Äù would be entered in the first \\nname field.\\nIf an individual‚Äôs name typically is written with the family name first, that family name should be \\nentered in the last name field. \\n\\nBeneficial Ownership Information Reporting Filing Instructions \\nJanuary 2024 - Version 1.0\\n8\\nNo Middle Name: If an individual‚Äôs full legal name does not include a middle name, the middle \\nname field should be left blank.

The BOIR will then automatically fill the State field with the relevant \\nTerritory code. \\nNon-U.S. Addresses: When an address is not in the United States, enter the street address, city, \\ncountry/jurisdiction, and foreign postal code.  If a foreign address contains information that does \\nnot exactly match the BOIR address fields, provide the foreign address information in the existing \\nBOIR address fields regardless of whether the field fully matches the address information.  All \\nforeign address information should be reflected somewhere in the BOIR address fields provided.\\nNo abbreviations are permitted in city names, which must be completely spelled out.  A U.S. city name \\nmust match the city name used by the U.S. Postal Service for the associated State and ZIP Code. \\n4.\\t Unique Identifying Numbers\\nEnter all unique identifying numbers as a single text string without formatting or special \\ncharacters such as hyphens or periods.

Images of these identifying documents must be provided for all \\ncompany applicants identified in Part II (item 33) and all beneficial owners identified in Part III \\n(item 51) of the BOIR.  A complete, clear, and readable image of the page or side of the identifying \\ndocument containing the unique identifying number of the company applicant or beneficial \\nowner, and other identifying data must be provided.  An attachment to a BOIR cannot be larger \\nthan four (4) megabytes of data.  Multiple attachments may be added to a BOIR, but only one \\nimage attachment is permitted per company applicant or beneficial owner reported in a BOIR.\\n6.\\t Prohibited Words and Phrases\\nDo not use the following words or variations of these words in text fields of the BOIR:\\na.

Item Instructions\\nThe item instructions show a line item, or field, of the BOIR followed by line-by-line instructions \\non how to fill out each item.  \\nNOTE: Filers must provide information in EVERY field marked with the * symbol in ALL \\nCIRCUMSTANCES.  Filers must also provide information in all fields not marked with the * symbol \\nthat are applicable to the filer.
